A.3: Calcium supplements 


RECOMMENDATION A.3: In populations with low dietary calcium intake, daily calcium supplementation (1.5–2.0 g oral elemental calcium) is recommended for pregnant women to reduce the risk of pre-eclampsia. (Context-specific recommendation) 


Remarks • This recommendation is consistent with the 2011 WHO recommendations for prevention and treatment of pre-eclampsia and eclampsia (57) (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence) and supersedes the WHO recommendation found in the 2013 Guideline: calcium supplementation in pregnant women (38). • Dietary counselling of pregnant women should promote adequate calcium intake through locally available, calcium-rich foods. • Dividing the dose of calcium may improve acceptability. The suggested scheme for calcium supplementation is 1.5–2 g daily, with the total dose divided into three doses, preferably taken at mealtimes. • Negative interactions between iron and calcium supplements may occur. Therefore, the two nutrients should preferably be administered several hours apart rather than concomitantly (38). • As there is no clear evidence on the timing of initiation of calcium supplementation, stakeholders may wish to commence supplementation at the first ANC visit, given the possibility of compliance issues. • To reach the most vulnerable populations and ensure a timely and continuous supply of supplements, stakeholders may wish to consider task shifting the provision of calcium supplementation in community settings with poor access to health-care professionals (see Recommendation E.6.1, in section E: Health systems interventions to improve the utilization and quality of ANC). • The implementation and impact of this recommendation should be monitored at the health service, regional and country levels, based on clearly defined criteria and indicators associated with locally agreed targets. Successes and failures should be evaluated to inform integration of this recommendation into the ANC package. • Further WHO guidance on prevention and treatment of pre-eclampsia and eclampsia is available in the 2011 WHO recommendations (57), available at: http://apps.who.int/iris/ bitstream/10665/44703/1/9789241548335_eng.pdf Summary of evidence and considerations Effects of calcium supplements compared with no calcium supplements (for outcomes other than hypertension/pre-eclampsia) (EB Table A.3) Evidence on the effects of calcium supplements on outcomes other than hypertension/pre-eclampsia was derived from a Cochrane systematic review (58). The review included data from 23 trials involving 18 587 pregnant women. The aim of the review was to determine the effect of calcium on maternal and perinatal outcomes other than hypertension. There is a separate Cochrane review on the latter (59), which has been referenced to support existing WHO recommendations on calcium supplementation to prevent pre-eclampsia in populations with low dietary calcium intake (38, 57). In 14 trials, daily calcium doses ranged from 1000 mg to 2000 mg, and in the remainder it was less than 1000 mg. Eleven trials started calcium supplementation at or after 20 weeks of gestation, five trials started before 20 weeks, and the rest did not specify when supplementation was initiated. The primary outcome of 16 of the trials was pregnancy induced hypertension. For outcomes other than hypertension, few trials contributed to each outcome; this is the evidence presented in this section. Maternal outcomes High-certainty evidence shows that calcium supplementation does not have important effects on maternal anaemia (1 trial, 1098 women; RR: 1.04, 95% CI: 0.90–1.22) or caesarean section rates (9 trials, 7440 women; RR: 0.99, 95% CI: 0.89–1.10). Moderate-certainty evidence indicates that calcium supplementation probably has little or no effect on maternal mortality (2 trials, 8974 women; RR: 0.29, 95% CI: 0.06–1.38) and probably makes little or no difference to the risk of urinary tract infections (3 trials, 1743 women; RR: 0.95, 95% CI: 0.69–1.30). Low-certainty evidence suggests that calcium supplementation may make little or no difference to maternal weight gain (3 trials; MD: –29.46 g per week, 95% CI: –119.80 to 60.89 g per week). Maternal satisfaction was not reported in any of the trials included in the Cochrane review. WHO recommendations on antenatal care for a positive pregnancy experience 28 Side-effects: Calcium supplementation makes little or no difference to the risk of “any side-effect”, a composite outcome including headache, vomiting, backache, swelling, vaginal and urinary complaints, dyspepsia and abdominal pain (1 trial, 8312 women; RR: 1.02, 95% CI: 0.93–1.12), and probably makes little or no difference to the risk of urinary stones (3 trials, 13 419 women; RR: 1.11, 95% CI: 0.48–2.54), renal colic (1 trial, 8312 women; RR: 1.67, 95% CI: 0.40–6.99) and impaired renal function (1 trial, 4589 women; RR: 0.91, 95% CI: 0.51–1.64), all assessed as moderate-certainty evidence. Low-certainty evidence suggests that it may have little or no effect on the risk of gallstones (1 trial, 518 women; RR: 1.35, 95% CI: 0.48–3.85). Fetal and neonatal outcomes Calcium supplementation probably has little or no ef fect on low-birth-weight babies (< 2500 g), as indicat ed by evidence that was of moderate certainty due to inconsistency (6 trials, 14 162 women; RR: 0.93, 95% CI: 0.81–1.07). Low-certainty evidence suggests that it may have little or no effect on preterm birth before 37 weeks of gestation (13 trials, 16 139 women; RR: 0.86, 95% CI: 0.70–1.05). However, when trials are stratified by dose (< 1000 mg vs ≥ 1000 mg), moderate-certain ty evidence shows that high-dose calcium supplemen tation probably reduces preterm birth (12 trials, 15 479 women; RR: 0.81, 95% CI: 0.66–0.99). Low-certainty evidence suggests that calcium supplementation may make little or no difference to perinatal mortality (8 trials, 15 785 women; RR: 0.87, 95% CI: 0.72–1.06), and moderate-certainty evidence shows that it probably has little or no effect on stillbirths or fetal deaths (6 trials, 15 269 women; RR: 0.91, 95% CI: 0.72–1.14). Additional considerations n n In the WHO recommendations for prevention and treatment of pre-eclampsia and eclampsia (2011), the recommendation on calcium states: “In areas where dietary calcium intake is low, calcium supplementa tion during pregnancy (at doses of 1.5–2.0 g elemen tal calcium/day) is recommended for the prevention of pre-eclampsia in all women, but especially in those at high risk of developing pre-eclampsia (strong recommendation)” (57). This recommenda tion is based on moderate-quality evidence showing a 64% risk reduction (CI: 35–80%) in pre-eclamp sia among women or populations with low baseline dietary calcium intake (57). n n In considering the evidence from the review of “non-hypertensive” effects, the GDG agreed that the effect of calcium on preterm birth is probably not distinct from the effect on preventing pre-eclampsia, as preterm birth is frequently a consequence of pre-eclampsia. Values Please see “Women’s values” in section 3.A: Background (p. 15). Resources The GDG noted that the cost of calcium (3 × 1 tablet 600 mg per day for 6 months = US$ 11.50) (27) is relatively high compared with supplements such as iron and folic acid. The weight of the supplement may also have cost and logistical implications with respect to storage and transport. Equity In many LMICs, women who are poor, least educated and residing in rural areas have worse pregnancy outcomes than do more advantaged women (29). Preterm birth is the most common cause of neonatal mortality, with the majority of deaths occurring in LMICs. Therefore, effective nutritional interventions in disadvantaged populations aimed at reducing preterm birth could help to address health inequalities. Acceptability Qualitative evidence indicates that women in a variety of settings tend to view ANC as a source of knowledge and information and that they generally appreciate any advice (including dietary or nutritional) that may lead to a healthy baby and a positive pregnancy experience (high confidence in the evidence) (22). However, Chapter 3. Evidence and recommendations 29 calcium carbonate tablets might be unpalatable to many women, as they can be large and have a powdery texture (59). In addition, this intervention usually involves taking three tablets a day, which significantly increasing the number of tablets a woman is required to take on a daily basis (i.e. in addition to iron and folic acid). This could have implications for both acceptability and compliance, which needs to be assessed in a programmatic context. Feasibility In addition to the cost, providing calcium supplements may be associated with logistical issues (e.g. supplements are bulky and require adequate transport and storage to maintain stock in facilities) and other challenges (e.g. forecasting). Qualitative evidence on health-care providers’ views suggests that resource constraints may limit implementation (high confidence in the evidence) (45)
