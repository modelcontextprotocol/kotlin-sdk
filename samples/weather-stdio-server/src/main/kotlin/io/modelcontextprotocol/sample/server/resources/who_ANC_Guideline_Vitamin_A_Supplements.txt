A.4: Vitamin A supplements 


RECOMMENDATION A.4: Vitamin A supplementation is only recommended for pregnant women in areas where vitamin A deficiency is a severe public health problem, to prevent night blindness. (Context-specific recommendation) 


Remarks • This recommendation supersedes the previous WHO recommendation found in the 2011 Guideline: vitamin A supplementation in pregnant women (60). • Vitamin A is not recommended to improve maternal and perinatal outcomes. • Vitamin A deficiency is a severe public health problem if 5% or more of women in a population have a history of night blindness in their most recent pregnancy in the previous 3–5 years that ended in a live birth, or if 20% or more of pregnant women have a serum retinol level below 0.70 µmol/L (61). Determination of vitamin A deficiency as a public health problem involves estimating the prevalence of deficiency in a population by using specific biochemical and clinical indicators of vitamin A status. • Pregnant women should be encouraged to receive adequate nutrition, which is best achieved through consumption of a healthy, balanced diet, and to refer to WHO guidance on healthy eating (41). • In areas where supplementation is indicated for vitamin A deficiency, it can be given daily or weekly. Existing WHO guidance suggests a dose of up to 10 000 IU vitamin A per day, or a weekly dose of up to 25 000 IU (60). • A single dose of a vitamin A supplement greater than 25 000 IU is not recommended as its safety is uncertain. Furthermore, a single dose of a vitamin A supplement greater than 25 000 IU might be teratogenic if consumed between day 15 and day 60 from conception (60). • There is no demonstrated benefit from taking vitamin A supplements in populations where habitual daily vitamin A intakes exceed 8000 IU or 2400 µg, and the potential risk of adverse events increases with higher intakes (above 10 000 IU) if supplements are routinely taken by people in these populations (62). Summary of evidence and considerations Effects of vitamin A supplements compared with no vitamin A supplements (EB Table A.4) The evidence was derived from a Cochrane systematic review of 19 trials of vitamin A (with or without other supplements) compared with no vitamin A (or placebo, or other supplements) involving over 310 000 women (63). All but one trial (conducted in the United Kingdom) were conducted in LMICs, including Bangladesh, China, Ghana, India, Indonesia, Malawi, Nepal, South Africa and the United Republic of Tanzania. Most trials were conducted in vitamin A deficient populations, with one study including only women living with HIV. Trials varied considerably in design, including in the dose and timing of the intervention. Ten trials contributed data to the comparison of vitamin A alone versus placebo or no treatment. Maternal outcomes Moderate-certainty evidence shows that vitamin A supplementation in vitamin A deficient populations during pregnancy probably reduces maternal anaemia (3 trials, 15 649 women; RR: 0.64, 95% CI: 0.43 0.94), but that it probably has little or no effect on maternal mortality (4 trials, 101 574 women; RR: 0.88, 95% CI: 0.65–1.20). Low-certainty evidence on a composite outcome for maternal infection (including fever for more than one week at one week postnatally, puerperal fever greater than 38°C, subclinical mastitis and/or bacterial vaginosis) suggests that vitamin A supplementation may reduce maternal infection (5 trials, 17 313 women; average RR: 0.45, 95% CI: 0.2–0.99). Side-effects and other maternal ANC guideline outcomes were not reported in the trials. Fetal and neonatal outcomes High-certainly evidence shows that vitamin A supplementation makes little or no difference to perinatal mortality (76 176 women; RR: 1.01, 95% CI: 0.95–1.07), neonatal mortality (3 trials, 89 556 neonates; RR: 0.97, 95% CI: 0.90–1.05) or stillbirths (2 trials, 122 850 neonates; RR: 1.04, 95% CI: 0.98–1.10). Moderate-certainty evidence indicates that vitamin A supplementation probably has little or no effect on low birth weight (< 2500 g) (4 trials, 14 599 neonates; RR: 0. 1.02, 95% CI: 0.89–1.16), and low-certainty evidence suggests that it may have little or no effect on preterm birth (5 trials, 40 137 women; RR: 0.98, 95% CI: 0.94–1.01). Neonatal infections and congenital anomalies were not reported in the trials. Additional considerations n WHO recommendations on antenatal care for a positive pregnancy experience 30 n Moderate-certainty evidence shows that vitamin A supplementation reduces night blindness in pregnant women living in areas with a high prevalence of this condition (2 trials, approximately 100 000 women; RR: 0.79, 95% CI: 0.64–0.98). n n Miscarriage and teratogenicity have been associated with high vitamin A intake within 60 days of conception; however, a WHO expert group consultation in 1998 concluded that daily doses of up to 3000 µg per day after day 60 are probably safe, especially in areas where vitamin A deficiency is common (62). Values Please see “Women’s values” in section 3.A: Background (p. 15). Resources Vitamin A supplements are relatively inexpensive at approximately US$ 0.30 per woman per month (10 000 IU per day or 25 000 IU per week) (27). Vitamin A can be given as a daily or weekly supplement. Equity Effective nutritional interventions in disadvantaged populations could help to address health inequalities by improving nutritional status and promoting good maternal health. Acceptability Qualitative evidence suggests that women in a variety of settings tend to view ANC as a source of knowledge and information and that they generally appreciate any advice (including dietary or nutritional) that may lead to a healthy baby and a positive pregnancy experience (high confidence in the evidence) (22). Feasibility Qualitative evidence shows that where there are additional costs associated with supplements (high confidence in the evidence) or where the recommended intervention is unavailable because of resource constraints (low confidence in the evidence), women may be less likely to engage with ANC (45)
